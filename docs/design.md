# Design Analysis
This section of the documentation outlines the strengths and flaws of the device's design.

## Strengths
A major strength of this device is its ability to indicate where the timer is within a second. This is accomplished with the 4 single colour LEDs giving a clear visual of a second. Another strength is the buzzer which indicates both 1 second and 10 second intervals. The 10 second intervals are signified by the louder beep.

## Limitations
The first limitation is the countdown timer function. The device itself does not show the how much time is left, only whether or not the time has run out, requiring the variable value to be changed to increase or decrease the amount of time before it ends. Another limitation is the buzzer, the difference in volume isn't subtantial enough to be clearly and the constant beeping does get annoying after a while.

## Future Modifications
- Remove buzzer
- Use more LEDs or 7-segment displays to represent total time remaining/elasped more clearly
